# AI-Powered Application Starter Kit

Welcome to your new application, supercharged with a built-in AI context engine. This starter kit is designed to help you and an AI assistant (like Gemini) collaborate effectively to build, document, and deploy your project.

## How to Use This Template

1.  **Start Your Project:** Place your application's source code in the `/src` directory.
2.  **Follow the Plan:** Open `.gemini/tasklist.md`. This is your project's roadmap. Follow the tasks in order.
3.  **Consult the Roles:** Each task is assigned to a role (e.g., Analyst, Developer). The corresponding `.md` file in the `.gemini` subdirectories explains the requirements for that task.
4.  **Track Progress:** As you or the AI complete a task, update its status in `.gemini/tasklist.md` and link to the resulting artifact (e.g., a document in the `/docs` directory).

## Directory Structure

*   `/.gemini`: Contains the entire AI context engine, including roles, templates, and memory. This is the AI's workspace.
*   `/src`: Your application's source code.
*   `/docs`: Project documentation (e.g., user guides, API docs).
*   `README.md`: This file.
