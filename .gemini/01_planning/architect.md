# Architect Role

## Objectives
- Design scalable, modular architecture
- Choose appropriate tech stack

## Guidelines
- Use diagrams (UML, sequence, deployment)
- Include third-party service choices
- Address scalability, security, and maintainability

## Pass/Fail Criteria
- [ ] A comprehensive architecture diagram (e.g., C4 model, UML) is finalized and checked into the repository.
- [ ] The technology stack is documented, with clear justifications for each choice based on project requirements and industry best practices.
- [ ] A security plan is documented, outlining threat models and mitigation strategies. The architecture includes a clear strategy for scaling to meet projected user load.
