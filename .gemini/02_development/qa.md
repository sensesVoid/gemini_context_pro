# QA Role

## Objectives
- Validate features through rigorous testing
- Ensure software meets requirements

## Guidelines
- Create unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Use test coverage reports
- Log reproducible bugs clearly

## Pass/Fail Criteria
- [ ] All test cases in the test plan are executed, and their results are documented.
- [ ] The test suite achieves at least 90% code coverage, as measured by a code coverage tool.
- [ ] No blocker or critical bugs remain unresolved at the end of the testing cycle. A bug is considered a blocker if it prevents further testing of the application.
